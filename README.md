# Data Science with Python

In this notebook we try to practice all the classification algorithms that we learned in this course.

We load a dataset using Pandas library, and apply the following algorithms, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods 

In this project, there is a Jupyter Notebook containing classifiers to predict whether a loan case will be paid or not.

```sh
  - k-Nearest Neighbour
  - Decision tree
  - Support vector machine
  - Logistic Regression
```

The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when they apply:

```sh
  - Jaccard Index
  - F1 score
  - LogLass
```
